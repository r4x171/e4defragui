# e4defrag-gui
My first project "e4defrag-gui", based "e4defrag"
Thanks for the opportunity guys, this script is made for linux users, it works on gui interface in order to defragment the hard disk onto partitions.
I need help with the progress bar, and with the automatic return of the linux partitions on combo box
